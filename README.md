# DC-Metro-Alerts

Inconsistent DC metro times are really annoying and I don't like to wait a long time for the train. This script pulls live train data 
from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) API and sends me text messages for my route so I know when to walk over 
to the station. Significantly improves the quality of my commute to and from work.
